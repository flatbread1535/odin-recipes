Odin-Recipes

This project uses basic HTML to create a website that contains a list of links to three different recipes.
This project was created for The Odin Project with the intention of practicing basic HTML concepts such as writing basic HTML syntax, using header, paragraph, anchor image, and list tags, and using attributes for links and images.

This project contains:
* An index.html web page with an unordered list linking to three different recipe pages
* Recipe pages include: a header, an image of the recipe, a description about the recipe, a list of ingredients needed for the recipe, 
steps on how to make the recipe, nutritional information about the recipe, and a link back to the home page (index.html)
