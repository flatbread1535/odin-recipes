        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or more to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 onions, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (14.9 ounce) can dark beer (such as Guinness)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 springs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups chicken stock, or as needed to cover</li>
        <li>4 cups mashed potatoes (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until bacon is browned and crisp, 3 to 4
            minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer bacon into a large stew pot, reserving bacon fat in the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>Season beef chuck cubes generously with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. Turn heat to high under
            the skillet and sear beef pieces in the hot fat on both sides until browned, about 5 minutes. Place beef in
            the stew pot with bacon, leaving fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Turn heat down to medium; cook and stir onions in the retained fat in the skillet until lightly browned, 5
            to 8 minutes; season with a large pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Cook garlic with onions until soft, about 1 minute. Pour beer into the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon,
            scraping up and dissolving any browned bits of food into the liquid.</li>
        <li>Pour cooking liquid from the skillet into the stew pot. Stir in tomato paste, carrots, celery, thyme sprigs,
            sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and enough chicken broth to cover.</li>
        <li>Bring stew to a gentle simmer, stirring to combine; reduce heat to low and cover pot.</li>
        <li>Simmer stew until beef is fork-tender, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Stir stew occasionally and skim fat or foam if desired.</li>
        <li>Remove cover and raise heat to medium-high. Bring stew to a low boil and cook until stew has slightly
            thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard thyme sprigs and adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Arrange mashed potatoes in a ring in a serving bowl; ladle stew into the center of the potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
